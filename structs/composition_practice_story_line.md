# E-commerce Product Management System Scenario (Generated by GPT)

Imagine you are a software engineer working at a small e-commerce company called "ShopEZ." ShopEZ is experiencing rapid growth and needs to revamp their product management system to handle the increasing complexity of their product catalog. Your task is to design and implement the product management system using the Go programming language and struct composition.

## Requirements

- Each product has the following attributes: ID, Name, Description, Price, Category, and Stock Quantity.
- Products can belong to multiple categories, so a product can have multiple Category attributes.
- The system should support adding new products, updating product details, fetching product information, and managing stock quantities.
- ShopEZ wants to ensure that the system is modular and scalable, so they are keen on utilizing Go struct composition.
- The product management system should be well-organized, easy to maintain, and allow for future expansion without causing extensive code changes.

## Your Task

1. Design the basic structure of the product management system using Go struct composition. Consider how you can create reusable and modular components.
2. Implement the necessary functions to add a new product, update product details, fetch product information, and manage stock quantities.
3. Implement a way to associate products with multiple categories using struct composition.
4. Use proper error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues like duplicate products, out-of-stock situations, etc.
5. Demonstrate the usage of your implemented functions through a sample program that showcases adding products, updating product details, fetching product information, and managing stock quantities.
6. Write comments in your code to explain the purpose of each struct and function.

Remember to keep the principles of struct composition in mind while designing your solution. The goal is to create a flexible and maintainable system that can accommodate ShopEZ's growing needs.
